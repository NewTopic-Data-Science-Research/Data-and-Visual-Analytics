Average Degree = 1.118
The degree is the number of edges (connections) a node has. The average is the total degrees in the network (in and out) divided by twice the total nodes. Average is close to 1 because most nodes have 1 edge.

Network Diameter = 6
The diameter is the furthest distance between any two nodes in the network. Each connected node has a distance of 1.

Average Path Length = 3.879
The Average Path Length is the sum of all the shortest paths (distances) between all nodes divided by the number of possible paths.
